        Purpose and Function<br>
The purpose of the Pocatello Eats website is to provide a fast and convenient way of finding new restaurants within the city of Pocatello with ways of filtering results to easily determine exactly where it is you might like to go. Visitors will come to the site expecting to be able to find new restaurants in the area based on their likes and interests and compare and contrast various comparable locations based on ratings and reviews found within the website. The website will allow users to register with an account to save their preferences which will allow the Pocatello Eats website to provide relevant suggestions based on previous selections and any reviews that might have been left by the user. This would also allow the user to create and maintain custom lists of favorite locations and foods for easy reference in the future. 

<br><br>General Content Contained<br>
The information required for the function of the website will be any relevant information pertaining to the restaurants in the area including but not limited to price, food selection, food quality, ambience (for those who might be looking for a specific experience), quality of service, and location. Additionally, the website will look to work closely with the local establishments to provide users with information about service hours, upcoming specials, and provide a convenient way to plan and make reservations. This would have the added benefit of giving any business involved a fast and easy way to market to potential customers should they so desire. It would also require the information provided by the users via the accounts they have made and the data we could collect from that. We would also have a way to provide feedback pertaining to the website itself so that we can continue to update our content to better suit the needs of our visitors.

<br><br>Why Us?<br>
One of the main problems with similar websites such as Google Maps is its lack of focus. Google is great for finding anything and everything, but it leaves a lot to be desired when attempting to find something new. This website would only be focused on food joints in a pre-established region, which will allow us to focus on making sure we have all the information that could help a visitor to the website make an informed decision. However, like Google there would be an interactive map provided that would provide information such as proximity to the userâ€™s current location and would also provide the fastest route to the selected location based on their method of transportation. All of these features when combined will allow citizens of Pocatello, citizens of neighboring cities and visitors to the area to have a fast and easy method of finding and remembering their favorite restaurants. 

<br><br>Note For Grading<br>
The goal I have in mind for this website has a lot more functional content than written, so I haven't included as much text and likely won't include a majority of what I do have in the final product. The same applies to the images provided. Please let me know what your opinion is on this and what I might do to add more if you think I should.
